# Farfalla project

Farfalla is a Javascript library based on jQuery that can add some UI elements to a webpage. Specifically, it offers some accessibility improvements and typical solutions, e.g. the possibility to control page colors and/or font size ([homepage](http://farfalla-project.org)).

## Demo

You can try out Farfalla on its official website:

<http://farfalla-project.org>

## Usage

Farfalla can be used in at least two different ways:

* as a **bookmarklet**, see instructions on <http://farfalla-project.org/install/bookmarklet/>
* as a **website add-on**, see instructions on <http://farfalla-project.org/install/website-install/>

Plugins for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/odaapckfobecngbgpocjdmdidefckahc) and [Mozilla Firefox](http://code.farfalla-project.org/goodies/farfalla.user.js) are also available, but they are quite minimal and very experimental.
